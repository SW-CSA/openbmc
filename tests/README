Continuous integration Testing (CIT) is a framework in OpenBMC for continuous testing. Framework enables users to write tests
in open source and perform automated testing with a simple hookup into infrastructure.

CIT Workflow:
----------------------
Step1: Checkout
  User's own way to checkout

Step2: Build
  User's own way to build using bitbake

Step3: Upgrade
  User's own way to upgrade BMC in their environment
  Future: Use fw-util in CIT manual flow for all platforms

Step4: Tests
  Use python based CLI to invoke tests. CLI can be found here from root
  openbmc/tests/common/tools/CLI.py

  There is a json defined per platform to determine the tests to be executed by the tool.
  openbmc/tests/common/tools/<platform.json>

  Usage:
  python CLI.py wedge100.json <BMC ip> <userver ip> --verbose DEBUG

  This command will copy all test files to target BMC and run all tests "enabled" in json.
  Note: This step does not build or flash the BMC.

CITv2 is based on Python unittest framework that can help standardize test decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use it ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Load BMC image on target that supports python unittest
2) SCP the whole tests2 folder to target /usr/local/bin
3) To invoke tests, use the runner:
# python cit_runner.py --help
usage: cit_runner.py [-h] [--list-tests] [--platform {wedge,wedge100}]
                     [--run-test RUN_TEST] [--start-dir START_DIR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --list-tests          List all available tests
  --platform {wedge, wedge100}
                        Run all tests in platform by platform name
  --run-test RUN_TEST   Path to run a single test. Example:
                        tests.wedge100.test_eeprom.EepromTest.test_odm_pcb
  --start-dir START_DIR
                        Path for where test discovery should start default:
                        /usr/local/bin/tests2/tests/

Example 1:
python cit_runner.py --platform wedge100
> Will execute all tests that are supported for the platform

Example 2:
python cit_runner.py --platform wedge100 --list-tests
> Will only list all tests that are supported on a platform

Example 3:
python cit_runner.py --run-test <name>
> Will only run the test defined in "name"
> This option enables user to run a single test or even tests defined in a module.
> Running tests in a module is powerful to validate a whole feature , example fscd

Example 4:
python cit_runner.py --list-tests --start-dir <name>
> Useful to integrate the tool with external tools that only need to get the
tests lists without access to target BMC

Code structure:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

tests2---common (Contains the core part of tests and all base classes)
|
---------utils (Utilities used by tests , example shell etc)
|
---------tools (Tools used to generate data for tests from BMC example, GPIOS, i2c device tree)
|
---------tests
          |
          --------<platform> (Contains tests specific to a platform and data that drives base tests)
          |
          --------galaxy100
          |
          --------yamp
          |
          --------minipack

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Tests:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests are classified based on where they run and how they interact with BMC.
Currently tool supports the following:
1) Tests that directly run on BMC: This class of tests do not depend on
interfacing with main CPU
2) Tests that run outside BMC on like a external dev system: This class of tests
can interact with both BMC and main CPU. These tests can interact with BMC to
collect state example: power cycle tests, SoL tests etc
3) Stress tests: Similar to 1) and 2). These tests are meant to take longer time to
run, since they stress the SW module. Example: rest server

Following sections describe how to add new tests for the above types

Adding a new test that can directly run on BMC:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests get autodiscovered by the cit_runner , as long as test file name is test_*.py
To add new test

tests2---common ---> add base_XXX_test.py (Define tests in the class as test_XXX methods)
|
---------tests
          |
          --------<platform> ---> add test_XXX.py (Define tests in the class as test_XXX methods)


Adding a new test that run outside BMC like a external dev system:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests get autodiscovered by cit_runner , as long as test file name is test_*.py
To add new test

tests2---common ---> add base_XXX_test.py (Define tests in the class as test_external_XXX methods)
|
---------tests
          |
          --------<platform> ---> add external_test_XXX.py (Define tests in the class as test_external_XXX methods)
